# aTimeTravelSnakeGame

This project primarily focuses on a web GUI with rudimentary functionalities for adding subpages or other content. It is intended to serve as a foundation for one or more games or applications that can be launched either through a menu structure or used individually.

## History:

Over several months, I have been developing this project. We are slowly but steadily approaching the first major and perhaps most crucial milestone: completing the basic GUI and managing subpages and cookies. This lays the groundwork for the optimistic possibility of developing a game soon.

From the outset, a particular goal was to minimize reliance on external libraries. While this may be somewhat puzzling for some, it is rooted in the fact that this project started as a one-person exercise and evolved over time into what could be considered a portfolio project.

So, here we are at this point, and hopefully, we'll make even more progress next year.
